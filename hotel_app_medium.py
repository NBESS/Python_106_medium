# First, create a list of hotel dictionaries. 
# They should contain at least 3 identical dictionaries (like the one in the example above).

# Create a "while True" loop to show the following menu:
# 1. Print hotel room status
# 2. Check in customer
# 3. Check out customer
# 4. Quit


# - When printing, show all rooms for all hotels and the name of the occupant, if there is one.
# - When checking a customer in, make sure to choose a hotel as well as a room.
# - Do not let a customer check into an occupied room.
# - If the room is unoccupied, prompt for each piece of information (name, cell, etc.)
# - upon check out, print out whether or not the customer has paid
